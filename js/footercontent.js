        In addition to the above, we may use the information we collect to:<br>
        *	Provide, maintain, protect, and improve our services (including advertising services) and develop new services; and<br>

    <p><strong>3. Choices</strong><br>
        You can use your account on the Ask The Tarot website to review and control the information stored in your Ask The Tarot account. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some of the Ask The Tarot features and services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled.</p>    
    <p><strong>4. Information Sharing</strong><br>
        Ask The Tarot only shares personal information with other companies or individuals outside of Ask The Tarot in the following limited circumstances:<br>
        *	We have your consent. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information.<br>
        *	If we provide such information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.<br>
        *	We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Ask The Tarot, its users or the public as required or permitted by law.<br>
        If Ask The Tarot becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will ensure the confidentiality of any personal information involved in such transactions and provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>    
    <p><strong>5. Information security</strong><br>
        We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, including appropriate encryption and physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.
        We restrict access to personal information to Ask The Tarot employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to process it on our behalf. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution if they fail to meet these obligations.</p>
    <p><strong>6. Accessing & Updating Personal Information</strong><br>
        When you use Ask The Tarot services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. 
        We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case, where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Because of the way we maintain certain services, after you delete your information, residual copies may take a period of time before they are deleted from our active servers and may also remain in our backup systems for a period of time.</p>
    <p><strong>7. Enforcement</strong><br>
        Ask The Tarot regularly reviews its compliance with this Privacy Policy. When we receive formal written complaints, it is Ask The Tarot's policy to contact the complaining user regarding his or her concerns. We will cooperate with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that cannot be resolved between Ask The Tarot and an individual.</p>
    <p><strong>8. Changes To Privacy Policy</strong><br>
        Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent. We will post any Privacy Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of Privacy Policy changes).</p>
